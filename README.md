A CLI to interact with txtar archive files ðŸ“‚

## Project Description

[txtar] is an incredibly useful tiny archive format, able to trivially store a miniature filesystem in a single plain text file. It particularly shines for storing test cases!

Most of the time a txtar archive is created manually, but what if you already have a directory full of stuff and you want to instead store them in txtar. Or you have a txtar
archive that you want to instantly replicate on your filesystem!

That's where `txtract` comes in ðŸš€

## Installation

Compiled binaries for all supported platforms can be found in the [GitHub release]. There is also a [homebrew] tap:

```shell
brew install -cask FollowTheProcess/tap/txtract
```

## Quickstart

Recursively zip up the contents of a directory into a single txtar file named yourdirectory.txtar

```shell
txtract zip ./yourdirectory
```

Or go the other way, unzip a txtar file back into your filesystem:

```shell
txtract unzip yourdirectory.txtar
```
